# DoomNG

Aiming to replicate the feel of the old doom engine in a much smaller file size than modern engines can offer. Running of the OpenGL hooks of Monogame, might swap
to just Silk.net eventually, but for now I am saving time by not doing the nitty gritty of it. Its about 13MB for all the Monogame DLLs which is a lot, but for now I am fine with that cost as its saving me atleast a few hours of horred OpenGL work and resource management.
